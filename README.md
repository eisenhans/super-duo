Contains two projects which are part of Udacity's Android Nanodegree program.

Alexandria:

FootballScores:

1) apiKey:

I applied what I learned in the Android course and did not commit my private apiKey to my public github repository. In order to build the project, you need to define a property

FootballDataApiKey=`<your api key>`

in the file `<USER_HOME>`/.gradle/gradle.properties.
